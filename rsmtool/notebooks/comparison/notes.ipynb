    "- The models evaluated here are trained on features values truncated to fall within 4 standard deviations of their training set mean (i.e., not on the raw features values).\n",
    "- All correlations (feature-score correlation matrices, marginal correlations with human scores, partial correlations and partial without length) are computed on truncated and standardized values.\n",
    "- The item-level results are based on rounded, trimmed scores from ordinal least squares regression models.\n",
    "- The feature statistics, box plots, etc. are based on the training set. Only the evaluations of the model use the test set.\n",
    "- In the boxplots for feature values, the red dotted line indicates the threshold for truncation (Mean +/- 4\\*SD).\n",
    "- Percentiles are computed using SAS definition (i.e., \"Type 3\" as described [here](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/quantile.html). The mild outliers are defined as data points between [1.5, 3) \\* IQR away from the nearest quartile. Extreme outliers are the data points >= 3 \\* IQR away from the nearest quartile.\n",
    "- Principal component analyses use singular value decomposition and are computed after standardization and outlier truncation."
