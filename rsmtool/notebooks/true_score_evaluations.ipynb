According to Test theory, a *true* score is a score that would have been obtained if there were no errors in measurement. While true scores cannot be observed, the variance of true scores and the prediction error can be estimated using observed human scores when multiple human ratings are available for a subset of responses. In this notebook these are estimated using human scores for responses in the evaluation set. \n"
