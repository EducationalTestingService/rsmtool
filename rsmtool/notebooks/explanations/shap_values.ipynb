    "\n",
    "Shap values are generated using the [SHAP library](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and are approximations of [Shapley Values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value), a concept derived from game-theory. Briefly speaking, the value for a feature indicates, for every model decision passed to the explainer, how the model decision would be impacted by removing that feature. For a more in-depth explanation, please refer to this [summary article](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-how-ime-shapley-values-explains-predictions-d75c0fceca5a).\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, RSMExplain uses the [Sampling](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/shap.explainers.Sampling.html#shap.explainers.Sampling) explainer which computes shap values through random permutations of the features, a method described [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-013-0679-x).\n",

    "### Reading Shap values\n",
    "\n",
    "Shap values are additive representations of a feature's impact on a model decision. The sum of all shap values and the base value for a example yields the actual model prediction for that example.\n",
    "\n",
    "A shap value for a feature can be considered that feature's contribution to that specific prediction. By computing the averge of all absolute shap values for a specific feature, we can calculate that feature's average impact on the predictions for the data we are trying to explain. The average, mximum, and minimum absolute shap values for all features can be found in the `absolute_shap_values.csv` file in the `output` directory.\n",

    "### Things to consider\n",
    "\n",
    "- RSMExplain can only generate shap values for the examples contained in \"explainable_data\" and, if specified, \"sample_range\" or \"sample_size\". If the dataset passed is small, then the values derived may not be representative of the model as a whole. Plots displaying mean values for your shap values may be unreliable if your dataset was small or not actually representative of the data the model deals with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As long as a sufficiently large background set was passed, the shap values for individual examples may be considered reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you wish to analyze shap values manually, please refer to the `*shap*.csv` files in the `output` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you wish to use the generated shap explanation object for additional processing, you may unpickle `explanation.pkl`. If you chose specific examples via `sample_range` or `sample_size`, you can find them in the `ids.pkl` file where they are stored as a mapping between the position of the example in the dataset and the ID of the example."
