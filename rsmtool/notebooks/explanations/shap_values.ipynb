    "\n",
    "SHAP values are generated using the [SHAP library](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and are approximations of [Shapley Values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value), a concept derived from game-theory. Briefly speaking, the value for a feature indicates, for every model decision passed to the explainer, how the model decision would be impacted by removing that feature. For a more in-depth explanation, please refer to this [summary article](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-how-ime-shapley-values-explains-predictions-d75c0fceca5a).\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, `rsmexplain` uses the [Sampling](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/shap.explainers.Sampling.html#shap.explainers.Sampling) explainer which computes SHAP values through random permutations of the features, a method described [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-013-0679-x). Although the sampling explainer is model agnostic and should – in principle – work for any type of model, RSMExplain currently only explains regressor models they are the most commonly used model for automated scoring."
