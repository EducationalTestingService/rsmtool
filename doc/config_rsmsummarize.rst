.. _config_file_rsmsummarize:

Experiment configuration file
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This is a file in ``.json`` format that provides overall configuration options for an ``rsmsummarize`` experiment. Here's an example configuration file for `rsmsummarize <https://github.com/EducationalTestingService/rsmtool/blob/master/examples/rsmsummarize/config_rsmsummarize.json>`_.

There are two required fields and the rest are all optional.

summary_id
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An identifier for the ``rsmsummarize`` experiment. This will be used to name the report. It can be any combination of alphanumeric values, must *not* contain spaces, and must *not* be any longer than 200 characters.


experiment_dirs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The list of the directories with the results of the experiment. These directories should be the output directories used for each experiment and should contain subdirectories ``output`` and ``figure`` generated by ``rsmtool`` or ``rsmeval``.


description *(Optional)*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A brief description of the summary. The description can contain spaces and punctuation.

.. _file_format_summarize:

file_format *(Optional)*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The format of the :ref:`intermediate files <intermediate_files_rsmtool>` generated by ``rsmsummarize``. Options are ``csv``, ``tsv``, or ``xlsx``. Defaults to ``csv`` if this is not specified.

.. note::

	In the ``rsmsummarize`` context, the ``file_format`` parameter refers to the format of the intermediate files generated by ``rsmsummarize``, not the intermediate files generated by the original experiment(s) being summarized. The format of these files does not have to match the format of the files generated by the original experiment(s).

.. _general_sections_rsmsummarize:

general_sections *(Optional)*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
RSMTool provides pre-defined sections for ``rsmsummarize`` (listed below) and, by default, all of them are included in the report. However, you can choose a subset of these pre-defined sections by specifying a list as the value for this field.

    - ``preprocessed_features`` : compares marginal and partial correlations between all features and the human score, and optionally response length if this was computed for any of the models.

    - ``model``: Compares the parameters of the two regression models. For linear models, it also includes the standardized and relative coefficients.

    - ``evaluation``: Compares the standard set of evaluations recommended for scoring models on the evaluation data.

    - ``intermediate_file_paths``: Shows links to all of the intermediate files that were generated while running the summary.

    - ``sysinfo``: Shows all Python packages along with versions installed in the current environment while generating the report.


.. _custom_sections_rsmsummarize:

custom_sections *(Optional)*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A list of custom, user-defined sections to be included into the final report. These are IPython notebooks (``.ipynb`` files) created by the user.  The list must contains paths to the notebook files, either absolute or relative to the configuration file. All custom notebooks have access to some :ref:`pre-defined variables <custom_notebooks>`.

.. _special_sections_rsmsummarize:

special_sections *(Optional)*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A list specifying special ETS-only comparison sections to be included into the final report. These sections are available *only* to ETS employees via the `rsmextra` package.

section_order *(Optional)*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A list containing the order in which the sections in the report should be generated. Any specified order must explicitly list:

    1. Either *all* pre-defined sections if a value for the :ref:`general_sections <general_sections_rsmsummarize>` field is not specified OR the sections specified using :ref:`general_sections <general_sections_rsmsummarize>`, and

    2. *All* custom section names specified using :ref:`custom_ sections <custom_sections_rsmsummarize>`, i.e., file prefixes only, without the path and without the `.ipynb` extension, and

    3. *All* special sections specified using :ref:`special_sections <special_sections_rsmsummarize>`.

.. _use_thumbnails_rsmsummarize:

use_thumbnails *(Optional)*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If set to ``true``, the images in the HTML will be set to clickable thumbnails rather than full-sized images. Upon clicking the thumbnail, the full-sized images will be displayed in a separate tab in the browser. If set to ``false``, full-sized images will be displayed as usual. Defaults to ``false``.
