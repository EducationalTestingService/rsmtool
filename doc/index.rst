Automated scoring of written and spoken responses is a growing field in educational natural language processing. Automated scoring engines employ machine learning models to predict scores for such responses based on features extracted from the text/audio of these responses. Examples of automated scoring engines include `Project Essay Grade <https://pegwriting.com/>`_ for written responses and `SpeechRater <https://www.ets.org/research/topics/as_nlp/speech/>`_ for spoken responses.

RSMTool is a python package which automates and combines in a *single* :doc:`pipeline <pipeline>` multiple analyses that are commonly conducted when building and evaluating automated scoring models. The output of RSMTool is a comprehensive, customizable HTML statistical report that contains the outputs of these multiple analyses. While RSMTool does make it really simple to run this set of standard analyses using a single command, it is also fully customizable and allows users to easily exclude unneeded analyses, modify the standard analyses, and even include custom analyses in the report.

We expect the :doc:`primary users <who>` of RSMTool to be researchers working on developing new automated scoring engines or on improving existing ones. Note that RSMTool is not a scoring engine by itself but rather a tool for building and evaluating machine learning models that may be used in such engines.

The primary means of using RSMTool is via the :doc:`command-line <usage_rsmtool>`.
